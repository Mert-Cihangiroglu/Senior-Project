Dataset7.z is the zip file contains images we have performed our models on.

Basic.py file contains the Cnn model. There are lines we have commented out . You can uncomment those lines and activate dropout or add more convolutional layers to the model.

We have performed all our tasks on Google Colab platform thats why our data set directory  is differen in the code. You can change that directory to where you have located the dataset to perform tha tasks.

You also have to split the dataset before running the code.
